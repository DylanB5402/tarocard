# Banner

For some reason git decides that they don't want to push empty folders.
So I'm adding a markdown file for clarification.

This folder contains all the uploaded files for profile banners (banners).

## Usage

You **MUST** post to /upload/`upload type`/`upload id`.
In this case, you will post to /upload/banner/`user_profile_id`.

The form file input entry **MUST** have the name="file" tag 
(or whatever formFileName is currently set to in config.json `[app/config.json]`).

Because the id of the user might be different, make sure to dynamically change
where the POST address is.

*Example Code:*
```html
<!-- this form sends a post to /upload -->
<form id="myform" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data" action="/upload/banner/1">
  <input type="file" name="file">
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```
